#Stand With the Duwamish

This is an app and website designed to motivate change. Visitors will learn the story of the Duwamish, current and historical, and then are asked to take a stand.

##Take a Stand
In this section of the site, the user is helped along in creating an email to send to politicians who can make change happen. The user can email just one politician or time the time to email all five.

##Donate
On the donate page, users are directed to the Duwamish website. We hope to link to their Paypal to this site at a later date.
