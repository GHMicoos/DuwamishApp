          <p class="sirORmadam"></p>
          <p class="inputCause"></p>
          <p>Chief Sealth was the first signer of the Point Elliot Treaty of 1855 for the Duwamish tribe. We named the largest, most economically powerful city in Washington after their Chief, who honored his treaty and only to not receive the same from the United States government. At this point, his people are no longer recognized by the federal government despite a long history in the Puget Sound region.</p>
          <p>His people deserve the dignity of being recognized and the rights that go with that recognition.</p>
          <p>The Clinton Administration found evidence sufficient to recognize the Duwamish only to have the Bush Administration strip them of that right.</p>
          <p>It is unacceptable to have benefit so much from the Duwamish lands and yet not fulfill treaty promises to this group of people who have already suffered such historical trauma. It seem that with your support and influence, perhaps the Bureau of Indian Affairs would find that the evidence already accepted in 2001 by the Clinton Administration is enough and side with the Duwamish, ending 160 years of injustice.</p>
          <p>I urge you to look into this situation and take action. We must reinstate the recognition of the Duwamish tribe so that the healing process can begin for these people. </p>
          <p>Sincerely, </p>
